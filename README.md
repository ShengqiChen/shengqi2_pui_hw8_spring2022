**c. Description**

My website is an information tool called "A Beginner's Guide to Shop Groceries in Pittsburgh", and its purpose is for the target audience (CMU students who share the same passion for grocery shopping as I do) to come and check out different grocery stores (popular and niche) here in Pittsburgh. I want to convey my personal experience shopping in these different grocery stores and their respective pros and cons to users who would potentially find a new store that they would want to check out and visit sometime in person. When users do find a store they'd want to visit, they can add the store to their "favorite stores" list and save the store's address information for visiting later. It is engaging in that users can explore the different stores either by squence or by grocery type (a list of recommended grocery stores based on the type of grocery the user selected) and browse with two modes (day and night mode) as they see fit.

**d. Using the Website**

There is a big button on the bottom right of each page indicating next page on click. There is also a button for switching between day and night modes right under the next page button. On the top navigation bar, there are "select by store brands", "select by grocery type", "home", and "my favorite store list". By clicking "select by store brands", users can view the grocery stores in sequence. By clicking "select by grocery type", users can see a recommended grocery store list based on each type of grocery (e.g. meat). By clicking "home", the user is navigated to the home page. By clicking "my favorite stores", the users can see their saved stores at any time.

**e. External Libraries**

For this project, the only external library I used besides HTML/CSS & standard Javascript is JQuery. 
Name of the Tool: JQuery
Why Use It: Honestly because it's required lol. 
How I Used It: I've already used localStorage for storing favorite stores list and switching between day and night mode, so I just used JQuery for the button that is controlling the switch between modes.
What It Adds to My Website: Additional complexity.

**f. Iteration from HW7**

Basically the website is very close to my design in HW7. Except that the font I used in Figma is not available in CSS, so I went with Helvetica Neue.

**g. Major Challenges**

Of course, one of the challenges I encountered was using JQuery because I had no experience in using JQuery prior to this project besides some JQuery practices from W3 School, so trying to include that in my code is kind of difficult. Also, the switch between different modes was hard as well despite my experience using localStorage from Assignment 6. I had to use a different scheme of color and also edit the size of the text because in the night mode, the white text clashed with the white background shape and makes the text unreadable at first.
