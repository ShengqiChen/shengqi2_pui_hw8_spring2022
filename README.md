c. Description

My website is an information tool called "A Beginner's Guide to Shop Groceries in Pittsburgh", and its purpose is for the target audience (CMU students who share the same passion for grocery shopping as I do) to come and check out different grocery stores (popular and niche) here in Pittsburgh. I want to convey my personal experience shopping in these different grocery stores and their respective pros and cons to users who would potentially find a new store that they would want to check out and visit sometime in person. When users do find a store they'd want to visit, they can add the store to their "favorite stores" list and save the store's address information for visiting later. It is engaging in that users can explore the different stores either by squence or by grocery type (a list of recommended grocery stores based on the type of grocery the user selected) and browse with two modes (day and night mode) as they see fit.

d. Using the Website

e. External Libraries

For this project, the only external library I used besides HTML/CSS & standard Javascript is JQuery. 
Name of the Tool: JQuery
Why Use It: I've already used localStorage for 

f. Iteration from HW7

g. Major Challenges

In this project, the biggest challenge I encountered was using JQuery to implement the shift between day and night modes. I had no experience in implementing modes and using JQuery prior to this project besides some JQuery practices from W3 School.
